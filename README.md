So I had some issues with the previous repository, so I created it again.
Hello reader, my name is Ernest, and I am begginer in programming(and english too, so watch your eyes)
I am trying to learn programming, so I decided to log in github in order to learn it a litte bit more.
So, if you have any suggestions for me, tips or you see some problems in my code, please tell everything about it and feel free to change anything in my codes(but dont delete them and add comments pls :) )
Also, this is my second day of programming in git, so wish me good luck and look forward for new programms (and development of previous versions of codes)
